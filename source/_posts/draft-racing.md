Suicide! ... in the enemy fountain.
<!-- more -->

## Overview

Each allied champion that dies in the enemy fountain counts as a point. The first team to score **10 points** wins.
Each team can have **runners**, **defenders** and **roamers**.

**Runners** run into the enemy fountain. Good runners have any combination of stealth, jumps, dashes, teleports, speed and defense.

**Defenders** make sure enemy runners don't make it into the fountain. Good defenders usually have a combination of `cc` and burst damage.

**Roamers** are more rare. There is usually only one per team. A roamer's job is to roam around the jungle, warding and picking off enemy runners before they get to your team's defenders.

## Rules

1. You can't farm minions of neutral monsters.

## Banned summoner spells
